# IllustratorScripts
Modified Scripts for Illustrator CC, typically project specific

This is a kludge. Anyone who knows what they're doing can probably do this better. What it does:

1) Select source and destination folders, and for each compatible file in the source folder
    -Compatible files are by type, case sensitive (Much to my surprise a couple times)
2) Load file to 10Kx10K pixel artboard
3) Fit art to board proportionally, filling it. Proportionally, this usually saves over by a few pixels
4) Export specified file type to destination folder

Things I may get to, but probably won't: Dialogue to set specific art output sizes.
